Frank did the design for the top (States, State, Decls, Decl, Program, Platform)
Michael did the design for the bottom (Transitions, Transition, Stmts, Stmt, Expr)

Frank added the three tests for the sample files
Michael wrote getName(), getNumStates(), getNumVarUses(), and getNumDecls() and added the tests for them

We worked on most of the parse functions together, doing some on our own

For the writing in ast_tests.h we mostly wrote about the tests we each wrote.
